        <li>&frac14 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Peel outer skins from the garlic bulbs and cut about 1/4 inch from the top of each bulb to expose cloves; place each bulb onto a piece of aluminum foil, drizzle each bulb with 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil, wrap garlic bulbs in the foil. Place wrapped bulbs into a baking dish.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Bake the garlic in the preheated oven until soft, for about 30 minutes. Once done, let the bulbs cool down.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Place the lentils into a 5-quart pot and cover with water; bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the lentils simmer until they're tender, but not mushy, between 15 to 18 minutes; stir occasionally. Once done, drain the lentils in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse with cold water to cool; drain again.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Break the garlic bulbs apart and squeeze the cloves to release the cooked garlic. Place garlic into a large salad bowl and add the grape tomatoes, parsley, and green onions. Whisk balsamic vinegar with 1/4 cup of olive oil, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl. Fold the lentils into the mixture and pour dressing over the salad; <strong>gently</strong> toss to coat. Keep refrigerated until serving time.
